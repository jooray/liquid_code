About
-----
This code creates a non-standard QR code that I call liquid code. It is much
nicer than standard QR code.

I use it for business cards and doing nicer QR codes for my magazine articles
and Bitcoin donations.

Usage
-----

See example in liquidcode.rb. There's also a script to create business cards
from a CSV file (a PGP key fingerprint is included in NOTE when present). You
also need to change the company name in the ruby file.
